    <div id="wiki">Tell All Your Friends is the debut studio album by American rock band Taking Back Sunday, released on March 26,
        2002, through Victory Records. Forming in 1999, the group underwent several line-up changes before settling on
        vocalist Adam Lazzara, guitarist and vocalist John Nolan (pictured), guitarist Eddie Reyes, bassist Shaun
        Cooper, and drummer Mark O'Connell. They recorded the album with producer Sal Villanueva at Big Blue Meenie
        Recording Studio in New Jersey. After the release, they promoted it with various tours of the US alongside Brand
        New and the Used. Nolan and Cooper then left the group in 2003 and were replaced by Fred Mascherino and Matt
        Rubano, respectively. Soon afterwards, they went on a co-headlining tour with Saves the Day to close out the
        year. </div>
